## What is a Documentation Site?

I personally enjoy organizing my thoughts and have been doing so for a long time in lots of different notes apps. My thoughts as well as information I have collected over the years has often been written in a personal shorthand or formatted in way thats not conducive to sharing. The last several years I've been having trouble sharing the knowledge I've collected and thus has lead me to creating a documentation site in which I can publish my notes and thoughts. This will serve two purposes - it will force me to be more organized in my notetaking. Secondly, it will give me an easy way to share information with those around me who are interested in similar topics.

## How I got here

Over the last 15 years I have overcame some unlikely circustances. At points I was nearly homeless, broke and living in a room not much bigger than a closet in Colorado, eating canned chicken & tuna fish on days I could afford to take the bus into town to actually buy food. At that point, my car's head gasket was leaking and I didn't have the money to fix it or buy another vehicle. My bank account was over withdrawn, debt piling up I couldnt repay, I could hardly afford my prepaid t-mobile phone and the job I was working that provided my housing was entering a slow mud season with no expectations to keep me over the summer. I was a ski bum with a drinking problem, I worked at a resort and cleaned rooms and delivered firewood. People who traveled to the resort, in most cases, couldn't take their booz and pot back with them. So they left it in the rooms. I'm not going to lie, I had a lot of fun living that life. Being broke didn't bother me that much besides the fear of not being able to pay for reasonable health insurance and a reliable vehicle. But I didn't realize at the time was my life was a mess, and I needed a change.

To make a long story short - I found myself back on the east coast where I grew up. Established a support system which was a mix of family and new friends, cleaned myself up and reignited a childhood interet in technology. 

Since then I have not only started a career in IT, but I've been extremely successful. I've worked for Government agencies, consulted for start ups, large tech companies, banks and major healthcare providers as well.

## Whats important about the information I'm sharing

### 1. Privacy Erosion

As big tech companies expand their reach, our digital footprints are growing larger. Whether it’s social media, e-commerce platforms, or mobile devices tracking our every move, data collection has become ubiquitous. Governments and companies collect vast amounts of data, from our personal preferences to our political leanings, often under the guise of improving user experience or security. This can lead to a sense of “digital surveillance,” where individuals lose control over their personal information. As technology becomes more integrated into our lives, privacy seems to be an increasingly rare luxury.

### 2. Consolidation of Power

Big tech companies now have more power than many governments. Companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Apple influence everything from the news we see to the products we buy. These companies have monopolistic tendencies, often buying up smaller competitors and consolidating power within their respective markets. This not only stifles innovation from smaller companies but also creates a scenario where a handful of corporations control vast amounts of information and influence, raising concerns over their power to manipulate markets, public opinion, and even political outcomes.

### 3. Government Surveillance and Overreach

Governments worldwide have become increasingly reliant on digital surveillance tools to monitor their citizens. With advanced data-gathering capabilities, governments can track phone records, monitor social media, and even use facial recognition software to surveil public spaces. While these measures are often justified as a means of ensuring national security, they also risk eroding personal freedoms. Some countries use surveillance technology to suppress dissent and control public opinion, creating an atmosphere of fear and limiting citizens’ right to privacy.

### 4. Job Displacement and Economic Inequality

Automation, artificial intelligence, and other technological advancements have revolutionized industries, but they’ve also contributed to job displacement. With machines taking over routine tasks, many lower-skilled jobs are becoming obsolete, leading to growing economic inequality. The divide between those who can access and benefit from new technology and those who cannot is becoming more pronounced, especially in developing nations. Governments and tech companies alike face the challenge of creating policies and programs to reskill displaced workers, but progress has been slow.

### 5. Addiction and Mental Health Issues

Social media, streaming platforms, and other digital tools are designed to capture our attention. The “attention economy” has incentivized companies to keep users engaged for as long as possible, often using techniques like endless scrolling and personalized recommendations. Unfortunately, these practices have been linked to increased anxiety, depression, and even addiction, especially among young people. Governments and regulatory bodies have been slow to address this issue, leaving the responsibility largely in the hands of tech companies, who have a vested interest in keeping people online.

### 6. Environmental Impact

The tech industry is often seen as clean and modern, but it has a hidden environmental cost. Data centers, cryptocurrency mining operations, and manufacturing facilities consume massive amounts of energy and resources, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and e-waste. Tech companies have made some strides in reducing their environmental footprint, but the push for constant innovation often leads to a “throwaway culture” where devices are quickly replaced, leading to a rise in electronic waste.

### 7. Information Overload and Misinformation

The democratization of information is a double-edged sword. On one hand, we have access to more knowledge than ever before; on the other, we’re inundated with information—some credible, some not. Social media algorithms often amplify sensationalist content, leading to the spread of misinformation and even harmful conspiracy theories. This has made it increasingly difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction, and while some governments and tech platforms are working to curb misinformation, it remains a complex and evolving issue.

### 8. Tech Dependency and Skill Erosion

With the rise of smart devices and automation, we’re becoming more reliant on technology for everyday tasks. This dependency is convenient but also concerning. Skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and even basic memory are potentially being eroded as we rely on devices to do the thinking for us. For example, GPS has reduced the need to remember directions, and calculators make mental math less common. While these may seem like minor conveniences, over time, the dependency on technology can lead to a collective decline in essential skills.

## In Conclusion

I hope that by sharing my notes, thoughts, and whitepapers, I can help you develop and reinforce the importance of Personal Op Sec, Contingency Planning, Backcountry skills, Personal Health and alternative modes of Communication. The future is uncertain, and we can't afford to be unprepared for what lies ahead.
