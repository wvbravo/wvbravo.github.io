# Intro to Personal Cyber Security Hygiene

### Here are ten essential cybersecurity hygiene practices that can help keep your personal information and devices safe:

### 1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords for Each Account
Create complex passwords for each of your accounts, avoiding easily guessed phrases or repeated passwords. Consider using a password manager to help manage them securely.

### 2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Whenever available, enable 2FA on all important accounts. This adds an extra layer of security, typically through a code sent to your phone or an authentication app.

### 3. Keep Software Up-to-Date
Regularly update your operating system, applications, and antivirus software. Patches and updates often fix security vulnerabilities that could otherwise be exploited.

### 4. Be Cautious with Phishing Attempts
Verify emails, texts, or links, especially if they come from unknown or suspicious sources. Hover over links to check the URL, and don’t open attachments or click links from untrusted sources.

### 5. Use a Secure Wi-Fi Network
Avoid using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, and consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when connecting to unsecured networks. Ensure your home Wi-Fi is protected with a strong password.

### 6. Limit Personal Information on Social Media
Avoid sharing personal details, like your birth date, address, or vacation plans, on social media, as these can be used to answer security questions or predict behaviors.

### 7. Regularly Back Up Your Data
Create regular backups of your important data and store it in a secure location. This protects your files in case of ransomware or hardware failure.

### 8. Install and Maintain Antivirus Software
Use reputable antivirus software and keep it updated to detect and mitigate threats. Many antivirus programs offer real-time scanning to catch threats before they cause harm.

### 9. Manage App Permissions and Security Settings
Review app permissions, especially on mobile devices, and adjust security settings. Avoid granting unnecessary access to contacts, location, and files.

### 10. Practice Good Device Physical Security
Lock your devices with a PIN, fingerprint, or facial recognition. Avoid leaving them unattended in public places, and make sure they’re configured to lock after a short period of inactivity.

These steps will build a strong foundation for personal cybersecurity hygiene, protecting both your online and offline data from common threats.
